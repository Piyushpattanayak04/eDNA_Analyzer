# PhyloDive - AI-Powered Taxonomic Classification & Novel Organism Discovery

![PhyloDive Hero](httpshttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8343247/150182593-67a8ab2f-1b31-4f88-9b0a-5b9b4b7f8e7a.png)

**PhyloDive is a deep learning platform that revolutionizes environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis. It provides accurate taxonomic classification of known species and uncovers novel organisms from complex marine ecosystems.**

This repository contains the source code for the PhyloDive promotional website, designed to showcase the platform's capabilities, technical architecture, and its potential to transform marine biodiversity research.

## üåä The Challenge: Unseen Biodiversity

The world's oceans are teeming with life, yet it is estimated that **over 91% of marine species remain undiscovered**. Traditional methods for species identification from eDNA are hampered by several critical issues:

- **Incomplete Databases:** Reference databases like NCBI and SILVA have mislabeled entries, sequencing errors, and significant gaps, particularly for under-represented marine clades.
- **Closed-World Assumption:** Existing classifiers can only assign sequences to known taxa, forcing potentially novel organisms into ill-fitting categories and stifling discovery.
- **Technical Barriers:** Simple alignment-based or k-NN models lack the sophistication to learn robust, hierarchical patterns from noisy and complex genomic data.

These limitations create a bottleneck in our ability to monitor ecosystem health, track invasive species, and discover new life.

## üí° The Solution: PhyloDive's AI-Powered Pipeline

PhyloDive addresses these challenges with a multi-stage AI architecture that combines supervised learning with anomaly detection to provide a comprehensive analysis of eDNA data.

### Key Architectural Stages

1.  **High-Fidelity Preprocessing (QIIME 2 & DADA2):**
    - Raw sequence data is processed to produce high-resolution Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), minimizing errors and providing a clean input for the AI models.

2.  **Advanced Sequence Encoding (k-mer Embeddings):**
    - DNA sequences are transformed into rich numerical representations using contextual k-mer embeddings, allowing the model to capture complex patterns beyond simple sequence similarity.

3.  **Hierarchical Classification (Multi-Task Transformer):**
    - A powerful Transformer-based model is trained to predict the full taxonomic lineage (kingdom to species) in a multi-task learning framework. This approach respects the hierarchical nature of taxonomy and improves accuracy at all levels.

4.  **Novelty Detection (Autoencoder & Clustering):**
    - An autoencoder network, trained on the embedding space of known organisms, identifies sequences that deviate significantly from the learned distribution. These anomalies, representing potentially novel taxa, are then clustered for further analysis in the **Discovery Workbench**.
